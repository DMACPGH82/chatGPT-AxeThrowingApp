Install MongoDB: If you haven't already, you'll need to install MongoDB on your local machine. You can download it from the official MongoDB website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Set Up a Node.js Project: Create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project using npm init. This will create a package.json file for managing your project dependencies.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies (express, mongoose, and body-parser) by running the following command in your project directory:
npm install express mongoose body-parser

Create a MongoDB Database: Start MongoDB locally and create a new database for your project. You can do this by running mongod in your terminal to start the MongoDB server, and then use the mongo shell to create a new database.

Create MongoDB Schemas: Create separate files for your MongoDB schemas (Thrower, League, Match, PlayoffMatch) and define the schemas as shown in the code provided.

Set Up Express Routes: Create a new file for your Express routes (routes.js, for example) and define the routes as shown in the code provided.

Run the Server: Create a new file (server.js, for example) where you import your Express app and start the server. Use app.listen to specify the port your server will run on.

Test Your Endpoints: Use a tool like Postman or write test scripts using a testing framework like Mocha and Chai to test your endpoints by sending HTTP requests and verifying the responses.
